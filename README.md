# London-Weather-Prediction-and-Model-Evaluation

As global climate change intensifies, accurately predicting shifting weather patterns has become increasingly critical.

In this project, I focused on forecasting the mean temperature in London. I imported, preprocessed, and analyzed historical weather data while automating the training and evaluation of multiple machine learning models. The entire workflow was streamlined using functions, leveraging tools and techniques from scikit-learn and MLflow.
