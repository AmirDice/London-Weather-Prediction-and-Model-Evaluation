# London-Weather-Prediction-and-Model-Evaluation

As global climate change intensifies, accurately predicting shifting weather patterns has become increasingly critical.

In this project, I focused on forecasting the mean temperature in London. I imported, preprocessed, and analyzed historical weather data while automating the training and evaluation of multiple machine learning models. The entire workflow was streamlined using functions, leveraging tools and techniques from scikit-learn and MLflow.

- Applied machine learning techniques to forecast the mean temperature in London, recording the root mean squared error (RMSE) metrics using MLflow.
- Developed a model to predict "mean_temp" with an RMSE of 3 or lower.
- Leveraged MLflow to log the trained models, their hyperparameters, and corresponding RMSE values.
- Retrieved and stored the results of all MLflow runs as a variable.

## Models
- Linear Regression
- Decision Tree Regressor
